Dear <%=@user.name%>,

Thanks for managing your domain with DNSSocial.

The final step is to update your name servers for <%=@domain%>.

We are automatically checking your name server configuration every 1 hour. At registry, you need to update and point your name servers as follows:

a.dnssocial.com
b.dnssocial.com

Once updated, we will inform you through email. Your zone will be deleted if you do not point to DNSSocial NS after two(2) days. Do not worry you can re-register.



Warm Regards,

The DNSSocial Team.
