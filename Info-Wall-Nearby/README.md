#Info Wall Nearby
##Project Description
The basic idea is location based chatrooms (Android Apps)
1. Web2Py framework as server,
2. Google Place API is used to search for the places nearby

We did this App from 0 lines of code within 36 hours at the awesome event from #HITB #hackweekday #hackathon event.
Currently the project is at a very raw state.

UI, Security, Spams control etc.. need to improve.
We hope that this can give some idea and help to those who want to know how to connect with Google Places Api from Android and Web2Py as server side handler.

More to be updated for this open project soon..

Thank you [HITB]() for this awesome event.
